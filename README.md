# OS
Trying to learn about how an Operative System works. 

I am using linux 0.11 and the following tutorials: 

www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDev1.html 
and 
https://www.amazon.com/Art-Linux-Kernel-Design-Implementation/dp/1466518030

Code for the book: https://github.com/yuanxinyu/Linux-0.11

Also I am using https://www.amazon.com/Modern-X86-Assembly-Language-Programming/dp/1484200659 as assembly guide


To run the code:

  install nasm
  install qemu
  
  
  ./CompileAndBoot.sh
